# LyricLens ðŸŽ¶

LyricLens is a web application that allows users to search for music by providing descriptions, lyrics, or frequently used words in a song. It integrates with the **Spotify API** to fetch song previews and other details, as well as the **Genius API** to display full lyrics URLs. Though still in development, the backend logic using raw PHP OOP is functional.

## Features

- **Search Songs**: Find a song based on lyrics, keywords, or a description.
- **Spotify Song Previews**: Get a preview link for a song.
- **Artist and Song Details**: Display artist names and other details.
- **Lyrics from Genius**: Fetch full song lyrics from Genius.
- **Contribution Ready**: Users can star the repository or submit pull requests.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
Only backend functionality is currently completed. The frontend is yet to be implemented. Feel free to fork the project or contribute to the development.
